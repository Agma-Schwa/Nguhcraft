    /**
    * Import SavedLore as Lore.
    *
    * Once upon a time, this was a paper server, and we wanted to
    * be able to display enchantments with levels greater than 10.
    *
    * The problem with that was that, since we couldn’t change the
    * client because we were using a plugin, we had to resort to
    * rather horrible hacks to accomplish that: hiding the actual
    * enchantments using hide flags and formatting the enchantments
    * as lore. At the same time, some items also had *actual* lore,
    * so we had to find a way to deal with the generated lore that
    * should be shown to the client, as well as the actual lore that
    * needed to be appended every time we would generate the lore.
    *
    * To that end, a new tag was introduced to item stacks, called
    * ‘SavedLore’, which would store the actual lore of the item,
    * and be used to generate the lore to be sent to the client.
    *
    * This is no longer necessary, but we still need to clean up the
    * mess this left behind. Specifically, if there is a 'display' tag
    * that contains a 'SavedLore' entry, we need to
    *
    *    1. Delete the 'Lore' entry, if present.
    *    2. Rename 'SavedLore' to 'Lore'.
    *    3. Remove the 'HideFlags'.
