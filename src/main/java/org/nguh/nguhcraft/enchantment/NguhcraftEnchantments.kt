    * becomes the target; otherwise, any living entity within a certain
    * radius of the projectileâ€™s path becomes the target. Hostile entities

    * fire a copy of the projectile every tick, decrementing the counter
    * each time until it reaches zero. The weapon may rapidly lose
    * durability while in this state.

    * removed from the world, or the server stops, the hypershot state
    * is cancelled. The weapon cannot be used again while in hypershot
    * state.

    * have homing; the target selection is done separately for each new
    * projectile.

    * tick; the counter is still only decremented once per tick.
